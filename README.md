Rain Fall Prediction using Machine Learning.
Deployed link = https://rain-fall-in-australia-predict.herokuapp.com/

# Problem Statement:
To predict the Rain Fall in Australia.

# Approach:
The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.

# Project Various Step
## Data Exploration
I started exploring datasets using pandas, NumPy,matplotlib and seaborn.

## Data cleaning.

## Data visualization
Ploted colleration matrix to get insights about dependend and independed variables.

## Model Selection 
Made many Models
But selected RandomForest Regressor.

## Model Dump
As per selected trained model is dumped to pickled format for app development

## Ide used:
Pycharm

using Streamlit.
